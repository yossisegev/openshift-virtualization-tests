              <summary>Test execution plan request details</summary>

              As an expert software testing engineer, analyze all modified files in this PR and create a targeted test execution plan.
              You will create a change request comment on the 1st line of the 1st file in the pr with the test execution plan.
              If you fail to run or post a comment, retry.

              **Analysis Requirements:**

              1. Examine code changes in each modified file
              2. Identify affected code paths, functions, and classes
              3. Analyze pytest-specific elements: fixtures (scope, dependencies), parametrization, markers, conftest changes
              4. Trace test dependencies through imports, shared utilities, and fixture inheritance
              5. Detect new tests introduced in the PR

              **Your deliverable:**
              Your change request comment will be based on the following requirements:

              **Test Execution Plan**

              - `path/to/test_file.py` - When the entire test file needs verification
              - `path/to/test_file.py::TestClass::test_method` - When specific test(s) needed
              - `path/to/test_file.py::test_function` - When specific test(s) needed
              - `-m marker` - When specific marker(s) can be used to cover multiple cases.

              **Guidelines:**

              - Include only tests directly affected by the changes
              - Use a full file path only if ALL tests in that file require verification
              - Use file path + test name if only specific tests are needed
              - If a test marker can cover multiple files/tests, provide the marker
              - Balance coverage vs over-testing - Keep descriptions minimal
              - Do not add a follow-up comment in the PR, only the change request one
