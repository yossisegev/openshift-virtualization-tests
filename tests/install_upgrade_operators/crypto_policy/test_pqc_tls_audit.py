    Test that every CNV service negotiates PQC key exchange.

    Preconditions:
        - AAQ enabled
        - NetworkPolicy allowing test access to console-plugin pods
        - Worker node OpenSSL supports PQC groups
        - All CNV services with a clusterIP discovered
        - TLS runtime type (Go/OpenSSL) detected for each service

    Steps:
        1. For each CNV service, probe PQC key exchange using post-quantum TLS groups
           (X25519MLKEM768, SecP256r1MLKEM768, SecP384r1MLKEM1024)

    Expected:
        - No service is unreachable
        - On non-FIPS clusters: every service accepts PQC with at least one group
        - On FIPS clusters: Go services reject PQC (ML-KEM not FIPS-certified),
          OpenSSL services accept PQC with NIST curves
