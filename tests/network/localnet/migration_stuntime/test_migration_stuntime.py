"""
OVN localnet (OVS bridge) migration stuntime measurement tests over live migration.

Tests measure the connectivity gap (stuntime) during VM live migration on OVN localnet
secondary network, for both IPv4 and IPv6, for regression detection.
Stuntime is defined as the connectivity gap from last successful reply before loss
to first successful reply after recovery.

Stuntime is measured using ICMP ping from client to server in 0.1s intervals, using ping -D so each
log line includes a timestamp for gap calculation.
The under-test VMs are configured on an OVN localnet secondary network, with a single interface,
on which IPv4/IPv6 static addresses will be defined according to the environment the test runs on.

Client - The connectivity initiator VM that runs continuous ping toward the server VM.
Server - The connectivity listener VM that receives the ping and responds.
